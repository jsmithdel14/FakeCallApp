# FakeCallApp
# Overview


This application is a Kotlin app that allows the user to input a caller name or number and then send a fake call to the users phone. This app has three separate screens it goes through. The first screen is a basic interface where you input the caller name or number and has a button that goes to the next screen. The next screen is the screen that looks like you are receiving a call. If you hit the answer button that brings you to the last screen which looks like an active call screen 


The purpose of creating this app was to learn Kotlin as well as learning Android Studio. This is my first app in Kotlin and Android Studio but I plan on creating another app in a team so I thought this would be a great starter project for myself.

# Future Work

* I want to do improved work on the ui to make the call look more realistic 
* I want to add an option to be able to make a call to other people using the same input I use to get the name/number. If it is a name it will check for that name in your contacts list
* I want to add notifications and a timer so the call comes in later and sends a notification like a real call
